# Stencil Storybook Sample
This is a starter project for building a standalone Web Component using Stencil and showcasing it with Storybook.


## Installation

To start building a new web component using Stencil and live testing it on Storybook, follow the steps below:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vr33ni/stencil-storybook-sample.git
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
npm test
```

## Usage


## Storybook deployment

When trying to deploy Storybook to Github pages for the first time, following steps need to be considered:

Create a new branch ```gh-pages``` and switch to the new branch.

Run

```bash
npm run build:storybook
```

This builds storybook locally in the ```storybook-static```folder.

Remove ```storybook-static``` from your ```.gitignore``` file.

Run

```git add storybook-static && git commit -m "Initial storybook-static subtree commit"```

Run

```git subtree push --prefix storybook-static origin gh-pages```

In your repository, go to Settings > Pages > Build and Deployment and choose Deploy from Branch as source and gh-pages as the branch to deploy from.


### Contributing

+ Create an issue with your new feature description on Github
+ Go to the issue and create a branch from it. (Naming convention: 'feature/name-of-component').
+ After the feature is ready for testing, create a pull request and request review => On each new pull request, github actions trigger the deployment to a github pages preview url as well as a canary release that can be used to include and test the new feature in another web application
